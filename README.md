### About Me

I recently graduated from CU Boulder, where I double majored in **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics**. I work as a research assistant on **GHOST**, a National Science Foundation–funded project developing cutting-edge 5G security tools to protect sensitive information and ensure user safety in potentially hostile environments.

My contributions include:

* Developing **precise mathematical models** for network traffic
* Generating **2‑D and 3‑D intuitive data visualizations**
* Designing the **GHOST user interface** that enables military personnel to plan and execute deception operations effectively and securely

While my academic and professional background is rooted in STEM, I bring a **creative dimension** to my skill set. As a **songwriter and content creator**, I’ve built a successful platform on TikTok and YouTube where I share original music and storytelling. My experience in branding, advertising, and authentic storytelling has led to collaborations with brands and recognition as an official **ZAG influencer** for *Miraculous Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir*.
